# Tableau Analysis 

##  How many trips have been recorded total during 2019?

During the year 2019, there is a record of 404 947 trips made. The majority of them between July and September, that coincidentally is the summer, where more people are on vacations.

## What is the gender distribution?

The biggest gender of users is male. Approximately 3 times larger than the female users (286 000 males vs 92 000 females).


## How does the average trip duration change by age?

As we can see in the Story *Changes in the trip duration*, the average duration (Starting time subtracted from Ending time) is less than one second, which is not possible. But in reality, it means that the average trip duration is very short, while there are some people who record a large time, making the average seem odd. When plotting the trip duration instead of the average, we find that every trip is less than 30 seconds. This means that everyone is using this means of transport because of its efficiency, and to get to a close spot in the city.

The average trip duration plot is still of some use, in the same Story we can see that it increases in May, June, July, and September (Summer), or the months of vacation.

Now, about age, the group of people with a larger trip duration are young ones (born after 1995). There are some outliers, like the ones born in 1969 or 1901, but those are clearly young people just messing aroung in the registration due to the nature of the years.

## What are the top starting and ending locations?

The most commmon starting station is the same as the most common ending station, which we can see that it is the one
next to the Fitzgerald-Holota Memorial Plaza, which is also near a wide variety of restaurants and bars to visit.
Followed by this, the second most common starting station is the one located in Hamilton Park. This shows more evidence that people have been using the bike service mainly for leisure, either going to or leaving those places.
